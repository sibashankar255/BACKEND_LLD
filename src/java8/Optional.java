     *java optional class provides a way to deal with null values. it is used to represent a value is present
     * or not. java 8 added a new class Optional available in java.util package
     *
     * A null pointer exception is a common issue in java application. to prevent this, we normally add
     * frequent NULL checks in our code to check if a variable is not empty before we use it in our program.
     * Optional provides a better approach to handle such situations.
     *
     * you can view Optional as a single-value container that either contains a value or doesn't
     *
