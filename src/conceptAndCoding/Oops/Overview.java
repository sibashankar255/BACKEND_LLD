    //Oops:-
    //programs is divided into Objects
    //Objects provided data hiding, gives important to data
    //overloading is possible
    //inheritance is possible
    //code reuseability is present
    //


    //Objects and Classes
    //Object has 2 things :-
    //properties -> data variable
    //Behaviour / function -> data method work on data variable

    //Class is a blueprint of an object
    //to create an object, class is required
    //


    //4 pillars of oops

    //1.data Abstraction
    //it hides the internal implementation and shows only essential functionality to the user
    //it can be achieved through interface and abstract classes
    //

    //2.data Encapsulation
    //encapsulation bundles the data and code working on that in a single unit
    //also known as data hiding
    //declare a public getter, setter to modify and view the value of the variable
