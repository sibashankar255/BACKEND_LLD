package SOLID;

public class Overview {

    //Solid:-
    //1.maintainable:- bugs fixed
    //2.extensibility:-easier to add new feature
    //3.reusable
    //4.easily testable:- test coverage for codebase should be there
    //5.Modular
    //6.understandable :- proper naming

    //single responsibility principle,
    // open-closed principle,
    // Liskov substitution principle,
    // interface segregation principle,
    // dependency inversion principle




    //Design a bird
    //requirements:-
    //build a system where we have to store information about difference kinds of birds
    //

    //1.single responsibility principle:-
    //every code unit(method/class/package) in our code base should have exactly 1 responsibility
    //there should be exactly 1 reason to change to code
    //SRP get violated:-
    //many if else
    //monster methods
    //common/utils


    //2.open-closed principle
    //code should be open for extension but closed for modification
    //makes more extension
    //adding new features
    //abstract class -> bind
