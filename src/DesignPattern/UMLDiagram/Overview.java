    Types of UML:-

    Structural UML:-
    class diagram
    package
    object
    Component




    Behavioural diagram:-
    Activity
    Use case
    sequence

      How to create :-
      1.system boundary -> dotted rectangle
      2.use cases -> oval
      3.Actors -> out side dotted rectangle
      4.Includes ->
      5.Extends ->






    Class Diagram:-
    1.class:-
    name
    attributes
    methods

    representing methods/attributes:-
    1.Attribute

    Access modifier:-
    + public
    - private
    # protected

    2.methods

    modifier signature : datatype

    eg:- + changeBatch(str, str) : void



    2.Interface (no attributes)

    <<Name>>
    methods

    name enclosed by <<>>
    all methods are public - by default

    3.STATIC Attributes:-
    create another block/section

    name
    ---
    class_name : int  (static)


    4.Abstract class:-
    exactly like normal class

    represented in italic


    5. ENUMs

    Represented by name & separated value

    AnimalType
    BIRD
    MAMMAL
    REPTILE



    Representing relation between classes:-

    Inheritance:-
    parent -> child
    interface -> implementation
    basically -> extends/implements


    Association:-
    Has a relationship
    Having attribute of other class


    Association:-


    Aggregation:-
    collecting 2 things /classes that existed independently
    relation b/w 2 classes both
    Ticket - Show(attributes)
    A aggregates B even if object of A is deleted, B remains in system.


    Composition:-
    create something
    relation when A composes B if obj B cannot exist w/o obj A.
    if 2nd class doesn't have independent existance (both)
