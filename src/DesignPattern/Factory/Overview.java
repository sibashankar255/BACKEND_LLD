package DesignPattern.Factory;

public class Overview {
    /*
    Factory method is a method in interface which returns instance of another specific class

    Advantages:-
    switching DB - no major code change required.
    if factory was not used:
    would need multiple if-else checks.


    Abstract Factory:-
    divide responsibility
    case1:- has attributes/general methods
    case2:- has only factory method

    if one class/interface become very large due to many factory methods(break srp)
    divide in 2 interfaces

    1.all normal methods
    2.all factory methods


    Practical Factory:-
