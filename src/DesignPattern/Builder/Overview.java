    /*
    Telescoping constructor:-
    have many constructor
    internally -> telescope together

    need constructor -> to perform validation
    don't want many args

    rather than many params-> pass a <k,v> (map)
    datatype of key: string
    datatype of value: Object
    -<String, Object>

    lot of type casting
    client typo's


    Main issue was -> too many params
    compile time checks for keys + has key and values

    map wont work

    we can create a helper class and pass that as param
